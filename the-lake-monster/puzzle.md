Imagine you are sitting in a rowing boat in the middle of circular lake.
Standing on the edge of the lake is a hungry monster that cannot swim. The
monster wants to eat you. You want to escape.

You know that, if you can reach land, you can outrun the monster, but first
of all, you need to row to shore. Here is the issue: whilst you can outrun
the monster on foot, he can run faster than you can row the boat. Much faster.
The monster can run four times faster than you can row. Heâ€™s also a clever
monster and will always do that smartest thing to attempt to catch you; moving
around the shoreline, as needed, to maximize his advantage. If he touches you,
you are dead!

Can you escape?
