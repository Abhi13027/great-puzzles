# Dwarfs in blue hats: explanation

Consider a small example. Let's assume we only have 1 dwarf living in the cave. What will happen then?

Surely, he will step out on the first day as he is the only one there and there should be at least one dwarf wearing the blue hat... so it must be him!

What about 2 dwarfs? Well. The first day they will observe another dwarf (who is wearing a blue hat) and will not know the color of their own. However, they do know that if they would not wear a blue hat the other dwarf would step out because, again, there is at least one dwarf wearing a blue hat. This gives both of them information about the color of their own hat. It must be blue. So they both step out the second day.

Now what about 3? It gets a bit harder. I will leave it to you and will not spoil all the fun. If you want to read it, maybe you should not do the puzzles in the first place?
