# Dwarfs in blue hats

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-medium-yellow.svg)

There are 100 dwarfs that live in the cave. In addition to them there is the Snow White who lives in the same cave. Now, Snow White likes to dress the dwarfs in colored hats (she generally likes experiments and life in the cave is quite boring, you know...). The dwarfs are then faced with the following tasks:
- every day they exit the cave and stand in a circle. When they stand in the circle they can see all the other hats but not their own. The Snow White asks the ones that wear a **blue** hat to step out.

The dwarfs know for sure that **there is at least one dwarf who wears a blue hat**. In addition to that they are, of course, extremely logical and will only step out if they are 100% sure that they indeed wear a blue hat. Otherwise they will keep standing still.

The whole process repeats day after day (after day after day after day) until all the dwarfs in blue hats have stepped out.

**Question:** What will be happening if Snow White feels adventurous and dresses every single dwarf in a blue hat? The full answer would be to explain what will the dwarfs do, when and why.

As usual there is no communication between the dwarfs or the Snow White whatsoever (the heroes of the puzzles, generally are quite intrinsically oriented).
