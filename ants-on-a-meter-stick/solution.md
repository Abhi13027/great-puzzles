# Ants on a meter stick: solution

Answer: The maximal time is 100s.

All ants are identical. Consequently, the "collision process" between two ants
can be greatly simplified by imagining that they simply pass through each
other.

Now it is much easier to reason about the dynamics, because the ants do not
influence each other. The maximal time that a single ant can be on the meter
stick is 100 seconds (length divided by velocity).

Consequently, this is also the maximal time that 100 ants can spend on the
meter stick. There are several arrangements that lead to this solution. For
example, all of them starting on one edge, heading towards the other.
