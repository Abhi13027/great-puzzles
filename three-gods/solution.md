# Three Gods: solution

First, a note on terminology: If A and B are statements that are either true or false, then "A if and only if B" is a statement that is true if either both A and B are true, or if both A and B are false, and false otherwise.

Next, one can assume with no loss that the gods actually answer in English, since if A is a statement, then the question "Is A true if and only if 'da' means 'yes'?" will have the correct answer 'da' if A is true, and 'ja' if A is false, regardless of the meaning of 'da' and 'ja': If A is true and 'da' means 'yes', then the answer is 'da', if A is true and 'da' means 'no', then the answer is again 'da'. If A is false, the answer is 'ja' by the same argument. So any question can be reformulated in a way that you can ignore the translation problem.

Now for the three questions. Name the gods X, Y and Z, in no particular order. The main idea is to first determine a god that does not answer randomly.

1. Ask X: "Do you always answer truly if and only if Y answers randomly?"

    Suppose Y answers randomly. Then there are two cases: X answers truly, hence the statement is true, hence X correctly answers 'yes'. Or X answers falsely, hence the statement is false, so X gives the false answer 'yes'. If on the other hand Z answers randomly, the answer will be 'no' in each case by the same argument. Of course, it might also be the case that X herself answers randomly. So you can conclude:

    => If the answer is 'yes', Z does not answer randomly, otherwise Y does not answer randomly.

2. Ask the god that does not answer randomly: "Is 0 == 0?"

    Now you know the identity of said god.

3. Ask the same god: "Does X answer randomly?"

    Since you know whether the answer is going to be correct or incorrect, you can conclude the identity of X, and from that the identity of the remaining god.
