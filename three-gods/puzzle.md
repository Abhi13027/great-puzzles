You stand before three (all-knowing) gods and can ask them yes-or-no questions. You know that one of the gods always answers correctly, one always answers falsely, and one answers randomly, picking each of the two possible answers with a probability of 50%. You do not know who is who. Moreover, the gods understand questions in any language, but will answer in their own language, where "yes" and "no" mean "da" or "ja", but you do not know which is which.

Your task is to determine their identities using three questions. Each question can be posed only to one god at a time, but who you ask may of course depend on the answer of the previous question, and you may pose more than one question to any particular god.
