There are 5 rational pirates, A, B, C, D and E. They find 100 gold coins. They
must decide how to distribute them.

The pirates have a strict order of seniority: A is superior to B, who is
superior to C, who is superior to D, who is superior to E.

The pirate's rules of distribution are: the most senior pirate should propose
a distribution of coins. The pirates, including the proposer, then vote on
whether to accept this distribution. In case of a tie vote the proposer has the
casting vote. If the distribution is accepted, the coins are disbursed and the
game ends. If not, the proposer is thrown overboard and dies, and the next most
senior pirate makes a new proposal to begin the system again.

Pirates base their decisions on three factors. First of all, each pirate wants
to survive. Second, given survival, each pirate wants to maximize the number
of gold coins he receives. Third, each pirate would prefer to throw another
overboard, if all other results would otherwise be equal. The pirates do not
trust each other, and will neither make nor honor any promises between pirates
apart from a proposed distribution plan that gives a whole number of gold coins
to each pirate.

Given that all pirates are perfectly rational, what is pirate A's proposition?
