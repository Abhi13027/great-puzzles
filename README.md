## Guidelines for new puzzles

The following list tries to describe the type of puzzle that we are looking
for. These rules are *highly subjective*. They might make more sense if you
have already solved a few of the puzzles above.

1. **Puzzles should be fun to think about**. We like puzzles which can be
solved by out-of-the-box thinking. We like puzzles which can be solved by
logical reasoning. We *don't* like puzzles which can be solved by repetitive,
dreary calculations or brute forcing.

2. **Solutions should be satisfying**. We like puzzles with *Eureka* moments
where it is suddenly obvious that you found the solution, sometimes without
even checking. We like puzzles with surprising or counter-intuitive solutions.
We *don't* like puzzles where you go "meeh.. seriously?" if you see the
solution.

3. **Puzzles should be self-contained**. Puzzles should be clearly stated. If
additional questions arise while solving the puzzle, they should be irrelevant
to the solution.

### Examples of puzzles that do *not* belong on this list

1. [Zebra puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle). This can be
solved by putting a lot of work into it. While this can be great fun, it is
similar to solving a Sudoko - it involves long, repetitive work.

2. [String girdling Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_girdling_Earth).
While this is a nice question with a counter-intuitive answer, it is just a
simple math exercise that doesn't require puzzle-solving skills.
