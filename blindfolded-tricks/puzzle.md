You have been abducted by terrorists and blindfolded. They sit you down at a
table and tell you that if you can solve two puzzles then they will let you go.

## Puzzle one

There is a deck of 52 cards on the table in front of you. Ten of them are
face-up and the rest are face-down. Split the deck such that each new stack has
an equal number of face-up cards.

## Puzzle two

On one side of the table there are five dice which add up to 15. On the other
side of the table there are another five dice which add up to 13. You don't
know which side is which. Move some dice around so that the two sides of the
table have equal sums.
