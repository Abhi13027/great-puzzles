# Blindfolded tricks: solution, part 1

Take ten cards from the deck and flip them over.

## Explanation

When you take the ten cards from the stack, suppose that *k* of them are face-up (*0 ≤ k ≤ 10*). If you flip them over, *10 - k* cards will be face-up. In the remaining deck of 42 cards, also *10 - k* cards are face-up, so both decks have the same number of face-up cards.
