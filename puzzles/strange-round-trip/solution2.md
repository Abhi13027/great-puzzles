# Strange round trip: solution

Consider the circle of latitude *C* close to the south pole which is exactly
one mile in circumference. If you start anywhere on the circle which is located
*one mile north of C*, you will also come back to where you have started.

You will start by moving one mile south, travel one round trip along *C* and go
back along the same longitude to the point where you have started.

**But wait**. There are even more solutions. Did you find these, too?
