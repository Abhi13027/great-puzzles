# Missing square: solution

The important thing to note is that shape **A** is not a triangle (neither is
the bounding shape of **B**)! The slopes of the blue and green triangles are
different.

Consequently, there is no reason why the area of the bounding shapes should be
preserved. For a nice visualization, see
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_square_puzzle).
