# The lake monster: solution

Let the lake have a radius of *R*. The lake is divided into two regions. Inside
the circle of radius *R / 4*, your *angular velocity* is larger than the
monsters angular velocity. This means that if you row around a circle of radius
*r < R/4*, you can always reach a situation where the monster is 180° behind
you:

From here, you can row straight to shore. The remaining distance is *R - r ≈
3/4 · R*. The monster has to run a half circle along the shore, a distance of
*π R*. This is more than four times larger than your distance. You escape.
