# Burning ropes: solution

Let us call the two ropes A and B. To start, light *both* ends of rope A and
*one* end of rope B. It will take exactly 30 minutes until rope A burned off
completely. At this moment, light the *other* end of rope B. We know that 30
minutes have burnt off of rope B, so it will take another 15 minutes with both
ends burning.
