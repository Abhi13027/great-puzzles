There is a village of wizards and a village of dwarves. Once a year, the wizards go over to the village of dwarves and line all the dwarves up in increasing order of their height, such that each dwarf can only see the dwarves smaller than himself. The wizards have an infinite supply of white and black hats. They place either a white or a black hat on the head of each dwarf. Then, starting with the tallest dwarf (in the back of the line), they ask each what color hat he is wearing. If the dwarf answers incorrectly, the wizards kill him (the other dwarves can hear his answer, but can't tell if he was killed or not). What strategy can the dwarves use to minimize the number of dwarves that are killed? What is the most number of dwarves that will be killed using this optimal strategy?
