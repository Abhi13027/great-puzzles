# Ants on a meter stick: solution

Answer: The maximal time is 100s.

All ants are identical. Consequently, the "collision process" between two ants
can be greatly simplified if we think of them as simply passing through each
other.

Now it is much easier to reason about the dynamics, because the ants do not
influence each other at all. The maximal time that a single ant can be on the
meter stick is 100 seconds (length divided by velocity).

Consequently, this is also the maximal time that any number of ants can spend
on the meter stick. There are several arrangements that lead to this solution.
For example, all of them starting on one edge, heading towards the other.
