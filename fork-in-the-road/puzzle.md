You are travelling to KnightTown where all residents are Knights and always
tell the truth. You reach a fork in the road. One path leads to KnightTown and
the other to KnaveTown, where all residents are Knaves who always lie. You do
not know which road leads to which town. You encounter a person at the fork,
who is either a Knight or a Knave. You are allowed to ask only one question to
the person standing at the fork. What question can you ask to find the right
road, not mattering whether the person is a knight or a knave?
